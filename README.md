# GitHub Repository Analyzer

A tool for analyzing GitHub repositories and generating insights about code quality, contribution patterns, and documentation.

## Problem Statement

Many organizations struggle to efficiently assess and manage their GitHub repositories, leading to:
- Difficulty tracking technical debt across multiple repositories
- Inconsistent code quality and documentation standards
- Challenges in prioritizing maintenance tasks
- Limited visibility into repository health and activity patterns

This tool helps engineering managers and teams measure repository quality, identify improvement areas, and track progress over time through automated metrics collection and visualization.

## Features

- **Repository Analysis**: Analyze code structure, commit patterns, and issues
- **Quality Metrics**: Track documentation coverage, test coverage, and code complexity
- **Activity Insights**: Visualize contribution patterns and team collaboration
- **Recommendations**: Get actionable suggestions to improve repository health
- **Dashboard**: View key metrics and trends in an interactive UI
